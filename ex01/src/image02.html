<h1>Gymnastics</h1>
<p>
  Gymnastics is a sport that includes physical exercises requiring balance,
  strength, flexibility, agility, coordination, and endurance. The movements
  involved in gymnastics contribute to the development of the arms, legs,
  shoulders, back, chest, and abdominal muscle groups. Gymnastics evolved from
  exercises used by the ancient Greeks that included skills for mounting and
  dismounting a horse and from circus performance skills.
